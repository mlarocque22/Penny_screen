Screens New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ to find stocks under a set dollar threshold that have options

I have attached two text files that the code created. One is for all stocks under $5 that support options. The other is for all stocks under $10 that support options

This code is for use in a future project that involves then finding undervalued and highly volatile stocks under $5 and $10 in order to trade options on. 

In order to keep this repository from getting cluttered, besides the example text files, all the text files I am generating using this are in github.com/mlarocque22/stock_text_files



Robinhood does not support trading on many of the smaller NASDAQ stocks that will show up on the screen.
