Screens New York Stock Exchange to find stocks under a set dollar threshold that have options

I have attached two text files that the code created. One is for all stocks under $5 that support options. The other is for all stocks under $10 that support options

This code is for use in a future project that involves then finding undervalued and highly volatile stocks under $5 and $10 in order to trade options on
